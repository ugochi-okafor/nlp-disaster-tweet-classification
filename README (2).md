# NLP Disaster Tweet Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to disaster tweet classification. 
The notebook preprocesses, analyzes, and builds machine learning models to determine whether a tweet is about a real disaster.

## Overview
The notebook explores the problem of classifying tweets related to disasters using NLP techniques and machine learning models. 
It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of tweets labeled as either related to real disasters or not. 
It includes text-based tweets with target labels (1 for disaster, 0 for non-disaster).

## Installation
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
```

Additional dependencies may be required based on the notebook's implementation.

## Notebook Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Reads the dataset and inspects its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the text, removes stopwords, and applies tokenization.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes tweet distributions and word frequencies.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
5. **Model Training:** Trains machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Neural Networks.
6. **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Training
The following models are implemented in the notebook:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Deep Learning (if applicable)

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using classification metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, with insights on misclassified tweets.
